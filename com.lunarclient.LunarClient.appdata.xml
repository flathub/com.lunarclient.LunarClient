				<p>
					Hey everyone, our primary focus these past few weeks has been to fix bugs,
					implement new mods, and add quality of life features!
				</p>

				<p>
					We finally have the much-requested Quickplay Mod. This mod allows you to switch
					games on the Hypixel Network seamlessly.
					We also added a new mod called “Snaplook” that will enable you to change/toggle
					your perspective by pressing a set key (no, this is not freelook).
					Lastly, we added the 3D Skins mod that allows you to add more details to your
					extra skin layers.
					Along with adding these new mods, we completely revamped the Crosshair Mod,
					fixed some much-needed bugs, and improved various aspects of our UI.
					Oh – we also have Discord linking! If you aren’t yet in our Discord, make sure
					to join!
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, we are aware of launching issues on Intel macOS on versions 1.7, 1.8, and
					1.12.
					We are actively working on a solution and should have an update for this soon,
					sorry for the inconvenience.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you have any suggestions to improve Lunar Client, make sure to interact with
					us on our social media accounts.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are still actively searching for new hires. Specifically, we are looking for
					new client developers to implement and create new Hypixel Skyblock mods.
					Visit our jobs page for all relevant information.
